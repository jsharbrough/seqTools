To run program in unix terminal, type the following:

	python seqTools_v2.3.py <command> <input>

in which command can be any of the following:

	buildCodonDict
			Produces aa sequences of nucleotide sequence input assuming the genetic code from user 
			input. Input should be in fasta format, output will aa sequences also in fasta format.
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py buildCodonDict foo.fasta [options]
		Options
			-c	Dictates the genetic code to be used. [standard]
				vertebrateMt, echinodermMt, coelenterateMt, ascidianMt, standard, chlorophyceanMt, 
				yeastMt, bacterial, euplotidNuc, pterobranchiaMt, yeastNuc, flatwormMt, ciliateNuc, 
				invertebrateMt, trematodeMt

	buildSeqDict
			Primarily an internal tool that gets used to efficiently read-in fasta files. Will 
			return a key-value table with sequence tags as keys and sequences as values. 
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py buildSeqDict foo.fasta [options]
		Options

	reverseComplement
			Primarily an internal tool. If you would like to reverse translate all sequences in a 
			fasta file, use batchRevComp. reverseComplement can handle standard IUPAC ambiguity 
			codes. Returns the reverse complement of the input sequence. 
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py reverseComplement <sequence> [options]
		Options

	cigarCalc
			A useful tool without much infrastructure. More development coming. This tool decodes 
			cigar strings produced by mapping programs and returns the length of the alignment. 
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py cigarCalc <cigar_string> [options]
		Options

	unwrap
			Tool to unwrap fasta file sequences. Takes a fasta file as input and removes 
			intra-sequence carriage returns and tabs.
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py unwrap foo.fasta [options]
		Options

	batchRevComp
			Tool that obtains the reverse complement sequence of all sequences in a file and 
			outputs them to a new file. Can handle all IUPAC ambiguity codes.
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py batchRevComp foo.fasta [options]
		Options

	batchTranslate
			Tool to translate many fasta files. Takes a file of file names as input and 
			sequenctially opens each file and translates it by calling the buildCodonDict 
			submodule.
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py batchTranslate foo.fofn [options]
		Options

	vcf2Fasta
			Tool that produces a fasta sequence from a Variant Call Formatted (VCF) file. Tool uses 
			standard IUPAC ambiguity codes. Current filters include minimum 
			depth over the site and mapping quality assigned by the mapping program. 
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py vcf2Fasta foo.vcf [options]
		Options
			-rc	Reverse complement. Output will be the reverse complement of the mapped sequence.
				[False]
				True, False
			-d	Minimum depth requirement. Base calls with depth of coverage lower than -d will be 
				output as missing data (N). [10]
			-q	Minimum mapping quality threshold. Base calls with lower Phred-scaled mapping 
				quality than -q will be output as missing data (N). [30]

	seqRenamer
			Tool to rename sequences within a fasta file. Input must be fasta. Output will be another 
			fasta file with "renamed.fasta" as its suffix, and the original file name as its prefix.
			Renaming scheme can be numeric (default) or a fixed name. Numeric renaming will add "_n"
			to the end of the sequence tag, where n = the order of the sequence in the input fasta. 
			Fixed renaming will add a user-specified string to the beginning of each sequence tag 
			like follows: "><STRING>_sequenceTag".
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py seqRenamer foo.fasta [options]
		Options
			-n	Renaming method. If the default numeric renaming system is not used, the value
				following the option flag will be appended as a prefix to all sequences in the 
				fasta file. [numeric]

	fasta2fastq
			Makes a fastq file with fake quality scores (ASCII_BASE 33) of -q from a fasta input. 
			Note: input file handle MUST BE ".fasta"
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py fasta2Fastq foo.fasta [options]
		Options
			-q	Phred quality score for fake quality scores. Must be an integer. [40]

	nexus2Fasta
			Tool for converting nexus files into fasta files. Input should be a nexus file. Output 
			will be a fasta file.
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py nexus2Fasta foo.nexus [options]
		Options

	fasta2Nexus
			Tool for converting fasta files to nexus format. Input should be a fasta file, output 
			will be a nexus file. Nexus file will be compatible with Paup or MrBayes, depending on 
			option selected. Additional compatibility can be added by contacting the developer.
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py fasta2Nexus foo.fasta [options]
		Options
			-p	Identifies the compatibility mode desired. If you would like additional compatibility 
				added, please email developer. If paup compatibility is specified, a paup block at 
				the bottom of the nexus file will be written, which instructs paup to construct a 
				Neighbor Joinging Tree and a ML pairwise distance matrix of the alignment. [none]
				none,mrbayes, paup

	help
			Writes this menu to the standard output.
		Usage
			python seqTools_v2.3.py help 
			
Input should be in the form required by the submodule command. Note the program is case sensitive.

If you would like to know which command to use, type:

	python seqTools_v2.3.py help
